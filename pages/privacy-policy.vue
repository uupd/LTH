        <h3>European Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident or are otherwise located in the territory of Europe, this section provides additional
          details about the personal data we collect about you, and your rights granted by the EU General Data
          Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).
        </p>

        <p>Subject to certain limitations, the GDPR provides you the following privacy rights:</p>

        <p>
          Transparency and the right to information: Through this policy we explain how we use and share your personal
          information. However, if you have questions or concerns you can contact us any time at
          admin@legaltechnologyhub.com.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right of access, objection, restriction of processing, erasure, and portability: You can make a request to
          access, object, restrict, erase, or transfer any of your personal data here. You also have the right to
          withdraw your consent at any time when we process your personal data based on your consent.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right to opt-out to direct marketing: You have the right to opt-out at any time to receiving marketing
          materials from us by following the opt-out instructions in our commercial emails, by contacting us, or by
          adjusting your preferences under your Profile Details on the Site.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please note that we reserve the right to send you other communications, including service announcements and
          administrative messages relating to your LTH account, without offering you the opportunity to opt out of
          receiving them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right not to be subject to an automated decision, including profiling: We do not make automated decisions
          using your personal data that may negatively impact you. We use cookies and similar technologies on our Site
          to personalize your experience on the Site and recommending software products and services that may be of
          interest to you. For additional information or to opt-out see our Cookie Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. If you consider that the processing of your personal
          data infringes your privacy rights according to the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a
          supervisory authority, in the member state of your habitual residence, place of work, or place of the alleged
          infringement. Contact details for the EU data protection authorities can be found at
          https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm
        </p>

        <h3>Legal Basis for Processing (EEA and Switzerland only)</h3>
        <p>
          Our legal basis for collecting and using the personal data described in this policy will depend on the type of
          information and the context in which we collect it.
        </p>

        <p>However, we will normally collect personal data from you only in the following circumstances:</p>

        <p>Where we have your express consent to do so</p>

        <p>Where we need the personal data to perform a contract with you</p>

        <p>
          Where the processing is in our legitimate interests and is not overridden by your data protection interests or
          fundamental rights and freedoms
        </p>

        <p>
          In some cases, we may also have a legal obligation to collect personal data from you to protect your vital
          interests or those of another person (for example, to prevent, investigate or identify possible wrongdoing in
          connection with the Site or to comply with legal obligations).
        </p>

        <p>
          If we ask you to provide personal data to comply with a legal requirement or to perform a contract with you,
          we will identify such basis for processing at the relevant time and let you know if the provision of your
          personal information is mandatory or not (as well as the possible consequences associated with not providing
          such information).
        </p>

        <p>
          If we collect and use your personal data in reliance on our legitimate interests (or those of any third
          party), this interest will typically be to operate our Site, communicate with you in relation to your account
          or the Site, to solicit information from you, including through surveys, to share aggregated information with
          providers of listed products or services and other licensees of our research and report offerings, to measure
          interest in and improve our offerings and Site, to engage in marketing activities, and to otherwise customize
          your experience with LTH.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you have questions about or need further information concerning the legal basis on which we collect and use
          your personal information, please contact us at admin@legaltechnologyhub.com.
        </p>

        <h3>California Privacy Rights</h3>
        <p>
          If you are a resident of California, this section provides additional details about the personal information
          we collect about you, and your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, or “CCPA.”
        </p>

        <p>Subject to certain limitations, the CCPA provides you the right to request:</p>

        <p>
          That we provide you access to details on the categories or specific pieces of personal information we collect;
        </p>

        <p>That we delete any of your personal information;</p>

        <p>To not be discriminated against for exercising any of the above rights.</p>

        <p>
          If you would like to submit a request to exercise your California privacy rights under the CCPA, you may do so
          by contacting us at admin@legaltechnologyhub.com . We will verify your request using information associated
          with your account, including your email address. Further identification may be required. You may also
          designate an authorized agent to act on your behalf.
        </p>

        <h3>International Transfers</h3>
        <p>
          If you are accessing our Site from outside the United States, please be aware that your information will be
          transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central
          database is operated. The data protection laws of the United States may not be equivalent or as comprehensive
          as the data protection laws as those in your country.
        </p>

        <p>
          Information will be transferred to our facilities and to those third parties with whom we share it as
          described in this Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
          We have implemented appropriate administrative, technical, and physical security procedures to help protect
          the personal information you provide to us.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, only authorized employees are permitted to access personal information that you do not publish on
          the Site, and they only may do so for permitted business functions. Our security and privacy policies are
          periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary, and only authorized personnel have access to personal
          information that you have not published on the Site. In addition, we use encryption when transmitting your
          personal information between your system and ours, and we, together with our partners, employ firewalls and
          intrusion detection systems to help prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to your non-public
          information.
        </p>

        <p>
          Please bear in mind that submission of information over the Internet is never entirely secure. We cannot
          guarantee the security of information you submit via our Site while it is in transit over the Internet, and
          any such submission is at your own risk.
        </p>

          information from individuals under 18.

          information to us, we will delete or destroy such information as soon as reasonably possible. If you believe
          we might have this type of information, please contact us.
        </p>
