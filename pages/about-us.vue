            Nikki is passionate about the way that legal technology and innovation is unfolding across the world. In
            early 2019, running yet another fruitless Google search for use case functionality, it occurred to her that
            these searches must be even more difficult for firms whose target market is multi-lingual, and whose clients
            want tech-driven legal services delivered in multiple languages.

            Chris has found himself working repeatedly in legal marketing. In discussion with Nikki about the state of
            the industry, the absence of a unified resource for finding legaltech tools and information that was useful,
            comprehensive and reliable seemed like an obvious gap in the market.

      <p class="about-us__goal">
        <strong>Together</strong>, we set about building a resource that combined the most complete global legaltech
        directory with a powerful search, providing a unified resource for finding the right legaltech tools,
        consultants, events, awards and more, no matter where in the world you are.
        <br />
        <br />
        We will continue to build and maintain LTH to serve the needs and wants of the legaltech community. Get in touch
        with any feedback or suggestions to help us get there.
